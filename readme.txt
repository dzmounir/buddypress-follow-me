== Description ==

Buddypress Follow Me Add the ability for members to follow others and keep track of their site activity (like twitter). 
This plugin works exactly the same way that the friends component of BuddyPress works, however the connection does not need to be accepted by the person being followed.

The plugin integrates seamlessly with your site, adding a new activity stream tab, follow/unfollow buttons to member profiles and adds tab to display the users following/followers in the member page and total counts.

This plugin has been updated for BuddyPress 1.6, and uses features of BP 1.5 (in particular, BP_Component) that are not available in earlier versions of BuddyPress.

== Installation ==

Download and upload the plugin to your plugins folder. Then Activate the plugin.
To follow a member, simply visit their profile and hit the Follow button, or from any members directory.
